## Cinnamon Tools Legacy

These deprecated xlets were part of the [Cinnamon Tools](https://gitlab.com/Odyseus/CinnamonTools) repository. The reason/s for their deprecation are listed below. At the time of their deprecation, all xlets were functional. All the xlets in this repository are ready to use (no building required). I will not actively maintain them, but I might fix any possible issues if they are properly reported and are easy to reproduce and fix.

## Applets

### Extensions Manager

I created this applet as an exercise and mostly used it while developing it. And since I removed all my xlets from the Spices website and I don't use xlets from there, I don't find it useful at all.

### Popup Translator

I deprecated this xlet in favor of maintaining the **Multi Translator** extension.

### Wallpaper Changer

I ported this xlet from its Gnome Shell counterpart as an exercise and never really used it. Plus, Cinnamon already comes with a wallpaper changer feature; it isn't as configurable as this xlet, but it's better than nothing.

## Extensions

### Cinnamon Maximus Fork by Odyseus

Since I created the **Cinnamon Tweaks** extension with this extension integrated, I never used this extension again.

### Window Demands Attention Behavior

Since I created the **Cinnamon Tweaks** extension with this extension integrated, I never used this extension again.

## Redistribution
